### What is the Python ? 
#### Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. It is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.

### 1.Why we should learn python?
#### Python is an excellent pick for beginners or those who are new to programming. It's very easy to learn for beginning. Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics. Some reason to learn Python - 

- Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
- Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
- Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.



### 2.How many data types python?
#### Python has six standard Data Types:
1.Numbers
2.String
3.List
4.Tuple
5.Set
6.Dictionary

- String – It is a collection of Unicode characters (letters, numbers and symbols) that we see on a keyboard.
- Numerical – These data types store numerical values like integers, floating-point numbers and complex numbers.
- Boolean – A boolean is used when we wish to restrict data to True/False or yes/no options.
- Sequence types – These help us store ordered collection of similar or different data types. List, string, and tuples are the types of sequence data types.
